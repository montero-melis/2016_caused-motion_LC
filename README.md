README
======

This repository contains all data files and R-scripts used for the analyses
reported in the paper:

Montero-Melis, G., & Bylund, E. (accepted). Getting the ball rolling: the cross-linguistic conceptualization of caused motion. Language and Cognition. doi:10.1017/langcog.2016.22

Please contact the first author (GMM) if you are unable to reproduce the analyses or to report any other type of issue that needs to be fixed.


Files
-----

The repository contains data files, scripts to run the analyses and saved data.
The scripts and the data files should make it possible to reproduce all analyses,
especially if using the same package versions as reported in the original paper.
However, since some of the model fitting takes a long time, the fitted models
are also provided as saved data (in the form of R-objects, which have the file
extension ".RData").
